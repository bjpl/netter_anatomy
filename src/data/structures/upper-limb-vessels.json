    "description_full": "The median cubital vein is a superficial vein that crosses the cubital fossa obliquely, connecting the cephalic vein laterally to the basilic vein medially. It typically lies anterior to the bicipital aponeurosis, which separates it from the brachial artery and median nerve. The vein is highly variable in size and course. It receives tributaries from the deep veins via the deep median cubital vein (perforating vein). The median cubital vein is the most commonly used vein for venipuncture due to its size, superficial location, and relative immobility.",
    "clinical_significance": "The median cubital vein is the **preferred site for venipuncture** (phlebotomy, IV access, blood donation) due to its large size and stable position. The **bicipital aponeurosis** protects the underlying brachial artery and median nerve from needle injury. **Anatomical variation** is common (~30% of people). **Iatrogenic nerve injury** can occur if the needle penetrates too deeply. **Hematoma formation** is the most common complication. The vein may be **absent** in some individuals.",

It ascends medial to the axillary artery through the axilla and becomes the subclavian vein at the lateral border of the first rib. The vein receives tributaries corresponding to branches of the axillary artery, plus the cephalic vein. It lies anterior and medial to the axillary artery and is surrounded by the axillary lymph nodes. The vein lacks valves in its proximal portion.",
    "clinical_significance": "**Axillary vein thrombosis** (Paget-Schroetter syndrome or effort thrombosis) occurs in athletes and causes arm swelling. **Thoracic outlet syndrome** can cause venous compression. **Central venous catheterization** via the axillary approach is safer than subclavian but technically more difficult. **Axillary lymph node dissection** risks vein injury. **Air embolism** is a risk during catheter insertion due to negative intrathoracic pressure.

The vein arches over the first rib and receives the external jugular vein before joining the internal jugular vein posterior to the sternoclavicular joint to form the brachiocephalic vein. On the left side, it also receives the thoracic duct; on the right, the right lymphatic duct. The vein contains a valve at its junction with the internal jugular vein.",
