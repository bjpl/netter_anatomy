    "description_full": "The extensor carpi ulnaris has two heads arising from the lateral epicondyle (humeral head) and posterior ulna (ulnar head). The tendon passes through the sixth dorsal compartment in a groove between the ulnar styloid and head, held by a fibro-osseous tunnel. It inserts on the base of the fifth metacarpal. ECU is a key stabilizer of the distal radioulnar joint.",
    "clinical_significance": "**ECU tendinitis and subluxation** are common in racquet sports. **ECU subsheath injury** allows tendon subluxation with forearm supination. **ECU tendon rupture** can occur with forceful wrist extension. The muscle is involved in **triangular fibrocartilage complex** (TFCC) stability. **ECU syndrome** causes ulnar-sided wrist pain. The tendon is palpable over the ulnar head.",
    "origin": "Lateral epicondyle of humerus (common extensor origin), posterior border of ulna via common aponeurosis with FCU and anconeus",
    "insertion": "Tubercle on medial side of base of 5th metacarpal bone",
